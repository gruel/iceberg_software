   :Version: 1.129
   :URL: https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/

A set of Java command line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data and formats. Picard is implemented using the HTSJDK Java libraryHTSJDK, supporting accessing of common file formats, such as SAM and VCF, used for high-throughput sequencing data.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with the `qsh` or `qrsh` command, preferably requesting at least 8 Gigabytes of memory ::

    qrsh -l mem=8G -l rmem=8G

The latest version of Picard (currently 1.129) is made available with the command ::

        module load apps/binapps/picard

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with ::

        module load apps/binapps/picard/1.129

This module command also changes the environment to use Java 1.6 since this is required by Picard 1.129. An environment variable called `PICARDHOME` is created by the module command that contains the path to the requested version of Picard.

Thus, you can run the program with the command ::

  java -jar $PICARDHOME/picard.jar

  mkdir -p /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/picard
  mv ./picard-tools-1.129 /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/picard/1.129
